# Integrated analysis of co-expression patterns of histone variants and their chaperones across tissues from publicly available RNA-Seq data
This folder is to present my master project at Institute Curie, focused on studying RNA seq data of histones/chaperones variants to understand their co-expression relationships and their power in predicting cancers.
The python code in available in the code folder.
Also, the final master report is available as a pdf.
